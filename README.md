A discount wordle program that is very similar to the popular game, well Wordle that was aquired by the NY Times

Download the files in the download folder and then compile wordle.cpp using g++
I like to do g++ wordle.cpp -o wordle and then i run wordle by doing ./wordle
VS Code does automatically do that though, but my compiler uses MSYS2 version 11.2.0

Simulates a wordle game until you decide to quit
Program remembers you past games and makes sure that you do not get the same word that you previously had

Work in progress
